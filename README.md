# text2ucgppt

Open resources\hymn_text.csv within Notepad++ or a simple text editor - not excel and not a word processor. The file has an example in it of how it should look. This is the entire song with all the verses.

The very first line stays with the text that is there. 

Then enter the hymn number on the second line. 

Each line in the Hymnal should be one line in the file after the hymn number.

Go to the Gesangbuch web page and copy the entire song into the file. Then just press Enter for each new line.

Then run \text2ppt\text2ppt.py
